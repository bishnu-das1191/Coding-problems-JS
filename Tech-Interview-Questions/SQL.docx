SDET SQL Interview Questions :

Q. Print duplicate employees from an emp table.
A - select empname, count(empname) as empname from emp group by empname having count(empname) > 1;

Q. What are constraints and their types.
A - NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
    UNIQUE - Ensures that all the values in a column are different.
    PRIMARY KEY - A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
    FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables.
    CHECK - Ensures the values in a column satisfies a specific condition.
    DEFAULT - Set a Default value for a column if no value is specified.

Q. Explain different types of SQL commands.
A - DDL : Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate, Rename.
    DML : Select, Insert, Update, Delete.
    DCL : Grant, Revoke
    TCL : Commit, Roll Back, Save point
    Constraints : Primary Key, Foreign Key, Check, Unique, Not Null, Default

Q. Differentiate DELETE vs DROP vs TRUNCATE
A - DELETE : remove rows from a table.
    DROP : removes a table from the database.
    TRUNCATE : removes all rows from a table. (It is also a permanent delete, cannot roll back)

Q. How to do pattern matching and getting the details in sql.
A - Select empname where empname LIKE 'a%'; - empname starts with 'a'.
    LIKE '%a'; - empname ends with 'a'.
    LIKE '%a%'; - empname should have 'a' anywhere in name.
    LIKE '_a%'; - first letter is anything but 2nd letter should be 'a'.
    LIKE 'a_%'; - first letter should be 'a' and length should be 2 atleast and rest anything.
    LIKE 'a%y'; - 1st letter should be 'a' and last letter should be 'y' and in between anything.

Q. Find the 2nd Highest Salary from emp table.
A - Select name, MAX(salary) as salary from emp where salary <> (Select MAX(salary) from emp);

Q. What are Triggers
A - A Trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server.


Q. What are the ACID properties?
A - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Q. UNION and UNION ALL
A - The main difference is UNION removes duplicate rows, while UNION ALL retains all rows including duplicates.

JOIN = Cross Product + some condition on records

NATURAL JOIN : [ This is a Natural Join, in which at least one column is the same in both tables and we want to compare 1 record of one table with all records of another table and return the matched rows. Refer - Lec-39: Natural Join operation with Example | Database Management System].

Q. Find the emp names who are working in any department.
A - Select empname from emp, dept where emp.emp_no = dept.emp_no; 


SELF JOIN : Joining the table with itself.[create a copy of the same table t1 and t2 ]

Q. Find Student id who is enrolled in at least 2 courses. [1 Table containing s_id, c_id, since]
[Explanation : solved using SELF JOIN -Lec-40: Self Join operation with Example | Database Management System]
A - Select t1.s_id from emp where t1.s_id = t2.s_id and t1.c_id <> t2.c_id;

EQUI JOIN : This JOIN  allows us to combine data from two or more database tables based on a common column between them. This type of join uses the equals operator (=) in the WHERE clause to match the values in the columns

Q. Find the names of employees who work in a department having location same as their address. 
[ Lec-41: Equi Join operation with Example | Database Management System]
A - Select empname from emp, dept where emp.emp_id = dept.emp_id and emp.address = dept.location;






LEFT OUTER JOIN : It gives matching rows and the rows in the left table but not in the right table. [ Left Outer join =  Natual join + left table data ]
Lec-42: Left Outer Join operation with Example | Database Management System

Q. Print emp_no, emp_name, dept_name, location from emp and dept table.
A - Select emp_no, emp_name, dept_name, location from emp Left outer join dept ON (emp.depId = dept.deptId); 

Note : since we kept ‘emp’ table on the left side of ‘left Outer join’ text , all records of emp table will be printed even though deptId does not match.   


RIGHT OUTER JOIN: It gives matching rows and the rows which are in the right table but not in the left table.  [ Left Outer join =  Natual join + left table data ]
Lec-43: Right Outer Join operation with Example | Database Management System

Q. Print emp_no, emp_name, dept_name, location from emp and dept table.
A- Select emp_no, emp-name, dept_name, loc from emp Right Outer Join dept ON (emp.deptId = dept.deptId);

FULL OUTER JOIN : It gives matching rows and all the rows from both the tables eventhough they do not match.

Q. Print emp_no, emp_name, dept_name, location from emp and dept table using Full outer join.
A -  Select emp_no, emp_name, dept_name, loc from emp FULL OUTER JOIN dept ON (emp.deptId = dept.deptId);
