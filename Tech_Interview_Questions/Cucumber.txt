                Cucumber and TestNG Interview Questions
================================================================================

Q.How do you share state between steps in Cucumber?
- Using pico container , create a Context class and have setter and getter methods,
  use Maps as instance variable.
- Create a Dependency class
- Add methods to save state of steps using map.
- Inject the dependencies to all stepdefs: create a parameterized constructor in each step defs
    and pass above dependency class as an argument.
- Atlast use the dependency class to save the state in one step def class and use it everywhere.


Q.How to run tests in parallel ? [this approach is using cucumber with junit]
- This approach will execute feature file in parallel.
- make sure we have maven surefire plugin in pom.xml
- and under the configurations tag we need to write 
<includes>*TestRunnerPath.java</includes>
<parallel>methods</parallel>
<threadCount>2</threadCount>
- then create a new folder and create a new feature file which needs to be executed in parallel.
- now in Runner file : update the CucumberOptions file with feature file path and comment the tags if mentioned.
- and note that if framework is using singleton design pattern then we have to convert the driver instance to ThreadLocal<WebDriver> driver = new ThreadLocal<>() so that each thead will have its own single instance.
- then finally run using command 'mvn test'

Q. Write a sample TestNG Test case with DataProvider.
- @Test(dataProvider = "sample")
public void testing(String username, String pswd){	
}
@DataProvider(name="sample")
public Object[][] testdata(){
	return new Object[][]{
			{"user1","pwd1"},
			{"user2","pwd2"},
			{"user3","pwd3"}
	}
}
